# TireModelMatlab
Tire model in Matlab for checking Chrono

The main file is "Program.m".
generate2 creates data & functions for the rim of the wheel; these functions were already created; therefore, there is no need to uncomment it.
The same is true for friction forces (Force_cont); they are in the Syst function, but they aren't the main concern now, so they are commented on to speed up the calculation.

The files might be updated because the directions of bending forces are under consideration in Chrono & Matlab. For the correct solution, they should be applied in opposite directions.
